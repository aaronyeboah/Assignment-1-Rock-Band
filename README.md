SuperSonics Rock band Static front end website.

This read me file is for a 1960's rock band. I have created a new band using a very common band name "SuperSonics".
The website focuses on four major aspects: Tours, Music, Videos & Photos. these subtitles are in place to boost user activity and increse new visitors to brows the site and view future tour dates that they can purchase on the site.
The SuperSonics are celebrating their 50th anniverssary where some of the most iconic 60's rockstars have been honoured.

UX
This webesite was designed specifically for new and existing fans of the "Band" and provide easy means of accesability to webesite features such as the video and audio content. this project breaks the entire website into segments that user can scroll to or even click to access more inforatioin rather than waiting for the page to load which could ultimately ruin the users overall experience.

Features
Feature  - Tours/Music/Videos/Photos: Due to the wbsite content being displayed on the same page I have linked the navigation bar directly to each section of the website.

Additional features to be implemented in the future:
I will focus on using Javascript to make the web page more dynamic. I will also expand on the pages so that the different sections of the home page will preview the contant you are about to click on so that the new pages that will be added to the site will not compromise the information on the home page.
I would also change the type of card used to display the tour dates to a card that can accomdate images.

Technologies Used:
HTML5 and CSS3 was used to disign the website. I mainly used Bootstrap to code the majority of the website such as the Navigation bar and the Cards displaying the tour dates. 
I have used https://www.w3schools.com/ to help when embeding audio and video files directly to the website. 
https://htmlcolorcodes.com/ was used to color the page using hexidecimal values.

Testing
The testing stage ws broken up into 4 major stages:
Stage 1 - HTML tag positioning - Once I had finished creating the core content for the webiste, I tested to ensure that all relevant information can be clearly seen on the page.
Stage 2 - CSS Styling - Once the HTML had been succesfully added, i tested the colors added and the compitablity they had with eachother. 
Stage 3 - Bootstrap and other pre-written code - the pre-written code was used mainly for the nav-bar, the cards and the media. to ensre the code was written corrrectly, i tested as soon as I added each indidual code template. once the code ran succefully, i would then style the code to suit my specific tastes for the website.
Stage 4 - Adding media - The media files required the most testing due to the fact the file would not run properly or was corrupted. once the bugs had been fixed, i was then able to succesfully embed the media files in the relevant section.
Deployment
The index.html and the style.css file were directly loaded onto git up through an empty git repository.

Content
